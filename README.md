# Collaborative Filtering Based Anime Recommendation System #

This Anime Recommendation System was developed as a Semester Project for my Artificial Intelligence Course. This Anime Recommendation System is a Collaborative Filtering based Recommendation System which uses Apriori Algorithm to generate recommendations. 

### List Of Computation Files ###
1. Minimum Confidence Threshold 0.05.zip (Uploaded on Archive.org)
2. Minimum Confidence Threshold 0.1.zip (Uploaded on Archive.org)
3. Minimum Confidence Threshold 0.2.zip (Uploaded on Archive.org)
4. Minimum Confidence Threshold 0.4.zip (Uploaded on Githup Repo)
5. Minimum Confidence Threshold 0.6.zip (Uploaded on Github Repo)

## The Computation Files List is arranged In Decreasing Order Of Recommendation Quality and Files Size ##

I have uploaded 2 of my computation files on Github and 3 of them are uploaded on Archive.org. 

In order to directly generate recommendations without performing any computations, these computation files are necessary. Download anyone of the Computation files and Extract its contents where the "Anime Recommender Fastest.py" is present and run the python file. 

Link to download the Computation Files, that are uploaded on Archive.org, is given below:
